## My Fun Fact is that in 2008 My Brothers and I Jumped over My Youngest Brother on a 4-wheeler, and My Mom Didn't Find out until We Posted the Video on Facebook.

So in 2008 we were living in Carrollton and when my mom was gone we were forbidden from riding the 4-wheelers around the house. So while my mom was gone my brothers and I would play by driving around the house on 4-wheelers. One day it turned into us building ramps to jump, which turned into us building bigger ramps to jump, which of naturally turned into us wondering what kind of things we could  jump over....

Now is a great time to introduce you to my then 8 year old brother Logan, the youngest of us. Who we thought was the perfect height to be jumped with a 4-wheeler when laying flat on the ground, he eagerly agreed. But just before we laid him down someone had a moment of clarity that this could be dangerous. So to test the safety first we just placed a helmet on the other side of the ramp and confirmed that we could jump that. We decided it was about the same width.

There was only one more thing that was needed, video evidence. So while my brothers got ready to jump Logan, I grabbed a camera to record the whole thing. Continuing to take the needed caution, we put the helmet on Logan before we jumped him. My brother Beau took off on the 4-wheeler and went sailing over Logan. It was a massive success! And since felt we had taken all the necessary safety precautions my bothers uploaded the video to Facebook immediately. Only for my mom to receive a barrage of texts and calls asking what in the world we were doing.
