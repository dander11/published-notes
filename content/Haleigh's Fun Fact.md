## My Fun Fact is that in 2008 I Recorded My Brother Beau Jumping over My Youngest Brother Logan on a 4-wheeler, and My Mom Didn't Find out until We Posted the Video on Facebook.

So in 2008 we were living in Carrollton and when my mom was gone we were forbidden from driving the 4-wheelers. So while my mom was gone my brothers and I would play by driving around the 4-wheelers. One day it turned into us building ramps to jump, which turned into us building bigger ramps to jump, which naturally turned into us wondering what kind of things we could  jump over....

Now is a great time to introduce you to my then 8 year old brother Logan, the youngest of us. Who we thought was the perfect height to be jumped with a 4-wheeler when he laid flat on the ground, he eagerly agreed. But just before we laid him down someone had a moment of clarity that this could be dangerous. So to test the safety first we placed a helmet on the other side of the ramp and confirmed that we could jump that. We decided it was about the same width as Logan.

There was only one more thing that was needed, video evidence. So while Beau got ready to jump Logan, I grabbed a camera to record the whole thing. Continuing to take the needed caution, we put the aforementioned helmet on Logan he laid down on the ground. My brother Beau took off on the 4-wheeler and went sailing over Logan. It was a massive success! And since felt we had taken all the necessary safety precautions my bothers uploaded the video to Facebook immediately. Only for my mom(, who was still gone??,) to receive a barrage of texts and calls asking what in the world we were doing. She rushed home, made us take down the video, and ???
