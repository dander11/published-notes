### Tips for Getting Ready:
- We often offer her two sets of underwear and she can pick which one. I’ve laid out 2 with her outfit already. 
- We get dressed on the floor or her bed instead of her changing table if she's moving too much
- She wants to put own her own clothes most the time, she says “Nomi self” to try to communicate this 
- I will usually say “You can try on your own. Let me know when you need help!” 50/50 shot whether this works.
- She can pull on her underwear and pants with just a little bit of help to get them in the correct orientation, but sometimes she keeps saying she wants to do it and won’t actually do it. Don’t be afraid to just get her dressed yourself
- For her shirt you can hold it so that she can see through the head hole and she can pull it over her head. She needs help with the arms.
- For her socks she likes to try it herself too but I often have to help her put them on her feet. 
- Even if she fights getting ready, once her shoes and socks are on she’s usually happier.
- If she fights it really hard, we don't care that she changes her clothes that much. Just need to make sure she's not in a diaper.

### Bedtime Routine

- Put on Changing Table and give her a Paci (or four :) )
- Put on Diaper
- Put on PJs
	- Top Drawer of her dresser
	- She can pick them out, but she may be funny and pick socks/undies first and pretend that they are PJs. She thinks it's very funny. 
- Read Books
	- 2-4 books but totally up to you
- Sing some songs
- Start Sound Machine
	- Tap the silver ring on top to start the sound machine
	- The light will stay **off** but the sound will turn on
	- If the light comes on it went too far. You can hold your finger on the silver ring to turn it off and tap again to go to the first preset
- Turn off lamp
