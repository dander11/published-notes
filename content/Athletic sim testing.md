## Gameplay Feedback
General feedback


- I'm not sure what the numbers mean in my office? Are they priority?
	- Just realized that they are counters for how many tasks are left. 
- I feel like I should be able to click on the numbers to open up their respective tasks since they are the main thing catching my eye.
